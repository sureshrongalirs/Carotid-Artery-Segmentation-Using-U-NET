# Carotid-Artery-Segmentation-Using-U-NET
we demonstrate how to perform carotid artery segmentation from ultrasound images using a U-NET deep learning architecture. Carotid artery segmentation is a crucial step in diagnosing and monitoring cardiovascular diseases. U-NET, known for its accuracy in biomedical image segmentation, offers an efficient way to isolate artery boundaries from complex ultrasound data.

Steps we have used:
    Importance of carotid artery segmentation in medical diagnosis
    Dataset overview and preprocessing steps
    U-NET architecture
    Training and evaluating the model
    Visual results of segmented arteries

Performance metrics : IoU, Dice Coefficient

Technologies Used:

    TensorFlow / Keras
    OpenCV
    Python
    Medical Imaging Datasets
